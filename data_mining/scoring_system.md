## Create a Daily Tracking Form

Develop a form where individuals can input their daily activities and select the corresponding actions they've taken. Each action selected adds its allocated points to the daily score.

## Calculate Daily Score

Sum up the points earned from each activity to calculate the daily environmental impact score.

## Provide Feedback and Suggestions

Offer personalized feedback based on the daily score, suggesting areas for improvement or actions that could further reduce environmental impact.

## Encourage Improvement

Encourage users to aim for higher scores by making more sustainable choices in their daily routines.

## Update and Refine

Periodically review and update the scoring system to incorporate new insights or changes in environmental knowledge.

This system allows individuals to track their daily environmental impact and make conscious choices to increase their score by engaging in more eco-friendly behaviors.

## Scoring system

Score = total score of each section

The score for each section will be calculated as follows

Do only one action ===> get full points for that action
Do the 2nd action onwards ===> Get the full score of the highest action + 80% of the total score of all remaining actions
